<h1>Thunderware Recode SRC :)</h1>

<strong>(THIS ONLY INCLUDES MY CODE)</strong>
The owner will most likely continue to use <strong>my</strong> base, so i'm leaking it!

I suggest people get started in minecraft client development.
But if you take credit for others work, I don't like you...

Everything here is my code (except from settings which I don't remember where I originally got them)

<strong>Why Did I Leak It?</strong><br>
> Retarded owner<br>
> Owner used MintyCodes tutorial in past<br>
> I can't stand retarded liers like this.<br>

<strong>Proof The Owner Skidded Old Version (Before I Was There)</strong><br><br>
