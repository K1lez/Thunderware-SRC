<strong>(THIS ONLY INCLUDES MY CODE)</strong>
The owner will most likely continue to use my base, so i'm leaking it!

Everything here is my code (except from settings)

<strong>Why Did I Leak It?</strong><br>
> Retarded owner<br>
> Owner followed a fucking mintycodes tut for his old client versions

I am allowed to leak this, as it is litterally mostly all my code...
